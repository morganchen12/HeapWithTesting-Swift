#HeapWithTesting

An exercise in [heapsort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort) and Xcode's built-in testing tools (new with Xcode 6).

The solution can be found on branch `solution`.

##Instructions

In `MutableArrayContainer.swift`, implement the `heapify` and `sortWithHeapSort` methods. Feel free to add any helper methods or tests. The reference test provided compares your heap sort with Cocoa's native `sort` function. At the top of `HeapWithTestingTests.swift` you'll also find a constant that specifies the length of the array generated for testing. 


This exercise is inspired by [Daniel](http://danielhaaser.com/) and [Benji](http://blog.benjamin-encz.de/) of [MakeSchool](https://www.makeschool.com/).

This exercise is the Swift version of https://github.com/morganchen12/HeapWithTesting
